## Quick Actions
The plugin provides several ribbon buttons for quick access:
- **ðŸ“… Calendar Icon**: Automatically opens today's note for the current stream context

## Commands
The plugin provides several commands accessible via the Command Palette and ribbon buttons:

- **Open Current Stream Today**: Automatically detects which stream the current view belongs to and opens that stream's today note. This works whether you're in a file that belongs to a stream, a stream view, or a create file view. This is useful when you want to quickly jump to today's note for the current stream context.
  - **Command Palette**: "Open Current Stream Today"
  - **Ribbon Button**: ðŸ“… Calendar icon in the left sidebar
- **Toggle calendar component**: Shows/hides the calendar component.

Individual stream commands are also available if enabled in stream settings:
- **Stream Name, today**: Opens today's note for a specific stream.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
You can assign custom keyboard shortcuts to any of these commands through Obsidian's Settings â†’ Hotkeys. Some recommended shortcuts:
- **Open Current Stream Today**: `Ctrl+Shift+T` (or `Cmd+Shift+T` on Mac)
