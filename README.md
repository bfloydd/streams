## Features
- Multiple daily note streams.
- Full calendar for each stream.
- New view for missing notes.
- **Public API** for other plugins to access stream data.

## Getting started
- Add new stream in settings, "Daily Notes", pointing to where you store your daily notes. There will be a ribbon button and a command to get to Today's Daily Note. Disable core Daily Note plugin.
- Then create another stream for work?
- Then create another stream for school?
- Then create another stream for... whatever.

## Quick Actions
The plugin provides several ribbon buttons for quick access:
- **ðŸ“… Calendar Icon**: Automatically opens today's note for the current stream context

## Commands
The plugin provides several commands accessible via the Command Palette and ribbon buttons:

- **Open Current Stream Today**: Automatically detects which stream the current view belongs to and opens that stream's today note. This works whether you're in a file that belongs to a stream, a stream view, or a create file view. This is useful when you want to quickly jump to today's note for the current stream context.
  - **Command Palette**: "Open Current Stream Today"
  - **Ribbon Button**: ðŸ“… Calendar icon in the left sidebar
- **Toggle calendar component**: Shows/hides the calendar component.

Individual stream commands are also available if enabled in stream settings:
- **Stream Name, today**: Opens today's note for a specific stream.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
You can assign custom keyboard shortcuts to any of these commands through Obsidian's Settings â†’ Hotkeys. Some recommended shortcuts:
- **Open Current Stream Today**: `Ctrl+Shift+T` (or `Cmd+Shift+T` on Mac)

## Public API for Other Plugins

The Streams plugin provides a public API that other Obsidian plugins can use to access stream data and functionality.

### Quick Start
```typescript
// Get the Streams plugin instance
const streamsPlugin = this.app.plugins.getPlugin('streams') as StreamsPlugin;

if (streamsPlugin) {
    // Get all streams
    const streams = streamsPlugin.getStreams();
    
    // Get active stream
    const activeStream = streamsPlugin.getActiveStream();
    
    // Get stream for current file
    const activeFile = this.app.workspace.getActiveFile();
    if (activeFile) {
        const stream = streamsPlugin.getStreamForFile(activeFile.path);
    }
}
```

### Available Methods
- `getStreams()` - Get all configured streams
- `getStream(streamId)` - Get a specific stream by ID
- `getActiveStream()` - Get the currently active stream
- `getStreamsByFolder(folderPath)` - Get streams matching a folder path
- `getStreamForFile(filePath)` - Get the stream containing a file
- `getStreamInfo()` - Get basic stream information
- `hasStream(streamId)` - Check if a stream exists
- `getStreamCount()` - Get total number of streams
- `getVersion()` - Get plugin version info
