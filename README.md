## All Streams Dashboard
The new All Streams view provides a comprehensive overview of all your configured streams. Access it via:
- **Ribbon Button**: Click the dashboard icon in the left sidebar
- **Command Palette**: Use "Open All Streams View"

This view displays each stream as a card showing:
- Total number of files
- Files created this year and month
- Last modified date
- Quick action buttons to open today's note or view the full stream

## Commands
The plugin provides several commands accessible via the Command Palette:

- **Open Current Stream Today**: Automatically detects which stream the current view belongs to and opens that stream's today note. This works whether you're in a file that belongs to a stream, a stream view, or a create file view. This is useful when you want to quickly jump to today's note for the current stream context.
- **Open All Streams View**: Opens the dashboard view showing all streams.
- **Toggle calendar component**: Shows/hides the calendar component.
- **Toggle calendar compact mode**: Switches between compact and full calendar display.

Individual stream commands are also available if enabled in stream settings:
- **Stream Name, today**: Opens today's note for a specific stream.
- **Open full view: Stream Name**: Opens the full stream view for a specific stream.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
You can assign custom keyboard shortcuts to any of these commands through Obsidian's Settings → Hotkeys. Some recommended shortcuts:
- **Open Current Stream Today**: `Ctrl+Shift+T` (or `Cmd+Shift+T` on Mac)
- **Open All Streams View**: `Ctrl+Shift+A` (or `Cmd+Shift+A` on Mac)
