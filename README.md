## All Streams Dashboard
The new All Streams view provides a comprehensive overview of all your configured streams. Access it via:

## Quick Actions
The plugin provides several ribbon buttons for quick access:
- **ðŸ“Š Dashboard Icon**: Opens the All Streams dashboard view
- **ðŸ“… Calendar Icon**: Automatically opens today's note for the current stream context

This view displays each stream as a card showing:
- Total number of files
- Files created this year and month
- Last modified date
- Quick action buttons to open today's note or view the full stream

## Commands
The plugin provides several commands accessible via the Command Palette and ribbon buttons:

- **Open Current Stream Today**: Automatically detects which stream the current view belongs to and opens that stream's today note. This works whether you're in a file that belongs to a stream, a stream view, or a create file view. This is useful when you want to quickly jump to today's note for the current stream context.

Individual stream commands are also available if enabled in stream settings:
- **Stream Name, today**: Opens today's note for a specific stream.
- **Open full view: Stream Name**: Opens the full stream view for a specific stream.
